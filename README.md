# Breast-Cancer-Detection
"Breast cancer detection using ML (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost) with robust preprocessing. Achieved 99% accuracy and 0.99 ROC-AUC."
# Breast Cancer Detection (UCI Dataset)

## Project Overview
Built & validated ML models (**Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost**) with robust preprocessing 
for breast cancer classification.  
Achieved **99% accuracy** and **0.99 ROC-AUC**, ensuring high predictive reliability 
on both clean and noisy data.

## âš™Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, handling noisy data)
- Compared multiple ML algorithms
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualized ROC curves for performance insights

## Results
- Logistic Regression: 99% accuracy
- XGBoost: 98% accuracy
- Robust even on noisy dataset
